This is  a hangman game coded mainly in C.
I keep working on it over time, so that it might become an actual cool game with a UI.
Here are the things that I want/might implement in the future :
- Word List: Instead of having the user enter a word every time they play, the game randomly selects from a list of words. 
- Difficulty Levels: Different difficulty levels to the game based on the length of the word or the number of attempts allowed. ✅
- Scoring System: Scoring system based on the number of attempts it takes the user to guess the word. ✅
- Hint System: Hint system that gives the user a clue about the word they are trying to guess.
- Save Game Feature: Save game feature that allows users to save their progress and come back to it later.
- Multiplayer Mode: Multiplayer mode that allows two or more players to take turns guessing letters in the same word. This could be done locally on the same computer or over a network connection.
- Leaderboard: Leaderboard that displays the high scores of all players.
- Word Definition: Feature that displays the definition of the word after the user guesses it correctly.
